I hooked up the TMP101 sensors to the BeagleBone and wrote get_temp.sh that takes the temperature
reading in Celsius and converts them to Fahrenheit.

I changed buttons_etchasketch.py to use the 8x8 LED matrix as opposed to using text.
Use the buttons to move the cursor.

I changed etchasketch.py to use either the rotary encoders or the buttons
with the 8x8 LED matrix.
