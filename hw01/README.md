Homework 1 - Etch-a-Sketch

To run etchasketch.py, simply run the program using the following command:
	./etchasketch.py

The board defaults to an 8x8 size. To change the board size, use the --size command as follows:
	./etchasketch.py --size 12

The above command creates a 12x12 grid as opposed to 8x8. Currently, this program only supports square boards.

Use the arrow keys to move the cursor. Press 'c' to clear the board.
