Homework 1 - Etch-a-Sketch

1) My BeagleBone boots with the provided 2019 Debian image.
2) This project was completed on the most up-to-date version of Ubuntu, running on VirtualBox.
3) I've obtained all the necessary components, including the supplies from the parts room.
4) I used git on my machine to submit the assignment.
5) I've joined the two groups and posted responses to your messages.
6) Below

To run etchasketch.py, simply run the program using the following command:
	./etchasketch.py

The board defaults to an 8x8 size. To change the board size, use the --size command as follows:
	./etchasketch.py --size 12

The above command creates a 12x12 grid as opposed to 8x8. Currently, this program only supports square boards.

Use the arrow keys to move the cursor. Press 'c' to clear the board.
