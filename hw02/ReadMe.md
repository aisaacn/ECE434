I modified etchasketch.py to take advantage of the buttons rather than a keypad.
Move the cursor using the buttons as if they were a directional pad.
Use the button not in the arrangement of four as the clear button.
Same as before, run the script with ./etchasketch.py with the optional --size
flag to modify the board size.

I also added led_controller.py, a python script that toggles the LEDs on the
board by pressing the buttons.
Run this script with ./led_controller.py
